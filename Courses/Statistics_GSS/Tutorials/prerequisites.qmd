To make the best out of these tutorials, you will need to install two things on your computer: R and RStudio.

## Step 1: Installing R

You can download R for Linux, macOS, or Windows on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/). CRAN is an abbreviation for the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

## Step 2: Installing RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R (and other languages such as Python) developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/), an open-source data science company. We highly recommend using RStudio, which will make your experience of working with R much more enjoyable. With RStudio, you can easily write your own scripts, run R code, manage your workspace, install and load R packages, view graphical output, and much more!
