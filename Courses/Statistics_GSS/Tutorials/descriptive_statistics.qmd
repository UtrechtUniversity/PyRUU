Start by setting up working directory and install R packages needed for the tutorial.

## Installing R packages

An R package is like a toolbox, except that instead of containing tools, it contains functions for performing specific tasks such as filtering data, calculate descriptive statistics (such as average, variance, standard deviation, etc.), or fitting a statistical model. Most of the R packages you will need for these tutorials are freely available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) or [GitHub](https://github.com/). You can install CRAN R packages using `install.packages()`. If you want to install an R package stored in a GitHub repository, use `install_github()` in the *devtools* R package.

## Exercise 1

Install an R package called *readxl*, which will allow you to import data from Excel files. When using `install.packages()` to perform this operation, remember to enclose *readxl* in quotation marks, as it is a character string.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true    

#Install an R package to import data from Excel files
install.packages("readxl")
```
